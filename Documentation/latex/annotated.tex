\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structnode}{node} \\*\hyperlink{structNode}{Node} which contains location, parent location and f g and h cost of the node }{\pageref{structnode}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structNode}{Node} \\*Basic \hyperlink{structNode}{Node} Structure for each block }{\pageref{structNode}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classoptimalPlanner}{optimal\+Planner} \\*Optimal Planner class members declaration we are using Astar algorithm for finding optimal path }{\pageref{classoptimalPlanner}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classRandomPlanner}{Random\+Planner} \\*The random planner tries to find a path to the goal by randomly moving in the environment (only orthogonal moves are legal). If the planner can not find an acceptable solution in less than max\+\_\+step\+\_\+number, the search should fail. The random planner, while being erratic, has a short memory, and it will never attempt to visit a cell that was visited in the last sqrt(max\+\_\+step\+\_\+number) steps except if this is the only available option }{\pageref{classRandomPlanner}}{}
